boulderdash.game2d
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demo code of Boulderdash. No sound, no frontend.

This is the source of a test version of boulderdash. I created this to test the map format which
will be added to game2d for a game I intend to develop.
The map format and game code was insprired by this [web site](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/10/25/javascript_boulderdash/)

You need my [game2d](https://github.com/wiebow/game2d.mod) framework to compile this code.

You can edit the levels by modifying the level.txt files in the media subfolder.
